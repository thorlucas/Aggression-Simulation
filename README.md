# Bromine: Game Engine
Bromine is lightweight. No need for an editor, no need for learning less powerful scripting languages. You just write C++. Thatâ€™s it.

## Quick Start
### Compilation
Bromine is a framework. You simply clone the Bromine repo, and write your code within it. Then, run `make` to compile.
